# Table-For-Scene-Tabs
This simple plugin for Godot adds a dock with a table that shows all open scenes as buttons. Left-click a button to switch to its scene tab. Right-click a button to change its background color. The background color for each scene button is saved. If a scene is closed and later reopened, the previously selected background color will be restored. You can reset a buttonâ€™s color using the reset color button in the color picker menu. If you discover any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out. Enjoy!
